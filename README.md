## Usage

In order to use the plugin, you need to add some sources to the plugin
configuration as commands in the form of lists of strings:

```lua
{
  sources = {
    javascript = { "node" },
    python = { "python3" }, -- "py" or "python" if you are on Windows
  },
}
```

or as functions that recieve the path to the file and the path to a binary,
and return the command:

```lua
{
  sources = {
    python = function(file_path)
      local on_windows = vim.uv.os_uname().sysname == "Windows_NT"
      return {
        on_windows and "py" or "python3",
        file_path,
        "-",
        vim.version().build, -- Pass Neovim version as an argument
      }
    end
  },
}
```

You can also pass either one of these to a table with extra options:

```lua
{
  sources = {
    typescript = {
      { "deno" },
      extension = "ts",
    },
  },
}
```

or:

```lua
{
  sources = {
    rust = {
      function(file_path, bin_path)
        return { "rustc", file_path, "-o", bin_path }
      end,
      extension = "rs",
      binary = true,
    },
  },
}
```

The function can also return a list of commands. In fact, in the previous
example, `binary = true` is just a shortcut for this:

```lua
{
  sources = {
    rust = {
      function(file_path, bin_path)
        return {
          { "rustc", file_path, "-o", bin_path },
          { bin_path },
        }
      end,
      extension = "rs",
    },
  },
}
```

When using the `extension` option, the plugin will copy the `snacks.scratch`
file to a temporary directory with the correct file extension. This is useful
when a runtime/compiler is giving you an error or behaving unexpectedly due to
scratch files having the wrong file extension (e.g. `python` instead of `py`)
or having percentage signs in the file name.

When you are in a scratch window, you can press `<CR>` to run the buffer.
You can also select some lines in visual mode and press `<CR>` to run only the
selected lines. You can press `q` to cancel the execution of the script while
it's running. Once the script is done running, you can see the standard output
and/or the standard error of the process. If the process wrote to both stdout
and stderr, you can switch between the two with `<Tab>`.

<h2 id="default-config">Default Config</h2>

```lua
---@class scratch-runner.Config
H.config = {
    ---Key that runs the scratch buffer.
    ---@type string?
    run_key = "<CR>",

    ---Key that switches between stdout and stderr.
    ---@type string?
    output_switch_key = "<Tab>",

    ---Commands that run your script. See :h scratch-runner.Source
    ---@type table<string, scratch-runner.Source | scratch-runner.SourceCommand>
    sources = {},
}
```
